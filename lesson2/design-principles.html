                    <div class="company-name">GitHub</div>
                    <div class="company-site"><a href="https://www.github.com">www.GitHub.com</a></div>

                    <div class="example__explanation">
                        GitHub has several examples of the rule of thirds.  First is in the images, but specifically in image in the second group or block.  The image has a counters in each of the corners of the top third.  They even use the character in the image to draw your attention to the numbers. The second way they use the rule is by making sure that the sections, especially the first, are two thirds or 4 thirds of a page to encourage scrolling for more visibility and discoverability.

                <div class="intro">
                    <div class="company-name">Patreon</div>
                    <div class="company-site"><a href="https://www.patreon.com">www.Patreon.com</a></div>

                <div class="example">
                    <img src="images/patreon.png" alt="Image from Patreon.com"> 
                    <div class="example__explanation">The white space on Patreon is a wonderful balance between keeping the site clean and showing the necessary information. The text when it is larger than a few lines then dim the extra text with an option to show more, then they follow that up with the links to the content. They are also showing 4 images with an option to scroll them.  These images are also following the rule of 3. The fonts are consistent and easy to read with plenty of margins and padding around the proper items.</div>

                <div class="example">
                    <img src="images/google.png" alt="image from google.com"> 
                    <div class="example__explanation">Fitts law is about items being in close to where the user is at or will be.  On the google web site there all the results sets are a full row.  So no matter how they are holding the device or screen the selection is easy to find. Scrolling is also easy, and navigating the site is thru vertical scrolling.  The browser also supports long pressing on a link to open in a new page or tab.</div>
